**This repository is deprecated**. It is no longer maintained, and it is not recommend for continued use.

Going forward, please use [cloudfoundry/bosh-cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli) which offers a superset of `bosh-init` and the old Ruby CLI `bosh` functionality. For more details on switching to `bosh`, please review the [summary of differences](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-diff/).
